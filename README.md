AnnSetu – Connecting Surplus Food to Those in Need

Overview
AnnSetu is a food redistribution platform designed to reduce food waste and fight hunger by seamlessly connecting restaurants, hotels, grocery stores, and individuals with surplus food to NGOs, shelters, and those in need.

With millions going hungry while tons of edible food is wasted daily, AnnSetu acts as a bridge to ensure excess food is safely collected, distributed, and consumed rather than discarded.

Key Features:
✅ Donor Dashboard – Easily list surplus food with details like quantity, expiry, and pickup time.
✅ Recipient Dashboard – Browse and request available food with real-time tracking.
✅ Google Maps Integration – Locate nearby donations and facilitate efficient pickups.
✅ Leaderboard & Impact Points – Recognizing top donors with a Zero Food Waste Badge.
✅ Partnerships with Swiggy & Zomato (Future Scope) – Enabling direct food donations via delivery platforms.

Why AnnSetu?

40% of food in India goes to waste, contributing to hunger and environmental harm.

No structured system exists for businesses and individuals to donate excess food efficiently.

AnnSetu ensures food reaches the right people, at the right time, reducing both waste and hunger.
