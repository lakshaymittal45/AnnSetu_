            <p>
                India produces 450 million tons of food annually, yet 40% of it (68 million tons) goes to waste. At the same time,over 195 million Indians (14% of the population) suffer from malnutrition and food insecurity. This mismatch between abundance and scarcity is what AnnSetu aims to solve.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission is to create an efficient, technology-driven food redistribution networkthat connects:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Restaurants, hotels, catering businesses, and event planners with NGOs, shelters, and food banks.</li>
                <li>Food donors with verified logistics providers and volunteers for real-time food collection.</li>
                <li>Corporates and government initiatives with surplus food management programs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By streamlining surplus food redistribution, AnnSetu ensures that fresh, nutritious meals reach the underprivileged instead of ending up in landfills.
